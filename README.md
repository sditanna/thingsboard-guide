# thingsboard-guide
This repo explains how to create a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol and to create a simple web site to display the data collected from the sensors.



### 1 - Thingsboard

The basic approach provides a Python script that generates random  values, which will be suddenly sent via MQTT to our dashboard on ThingsBoard. This guide follows the Thingsboard setup based on **Docker**, which can be accessed on Thingsboard guides, really clear and quick to follow.  All you need of this repository, in this first part, is in the folder **PythonSim**. 

For all details of this guide, from code to back-end, please follow these links:

### 2 - RIOT OS Application

In the next step of this guide we will try to collect values with **RIOT OS**,  a real-time multi-threading operating system with a lot of features; you can find all you need about here:
https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/2019.01-branch

We will also use **MQTT-SN** protocol, a variation of the known MQTT for Sensor Networks, and the Mosquitto broker, which in this case will acts as a bridge.
The additional parts, compared to the first step, are in the folder **RIOTSim**.

### 3 - LoRAWAN

In this new step we will replace the MQTT protocol and the short-range wireless medium with LoRaWAN and [TheThingsNetwork](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). The rest of the system is like the previous tutorial, but we need a new RIOT OS application. All you need is in the folder *example/LoRa*.
